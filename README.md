## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Malik Monte Smith, an Application Security Engineer & Tester at OnDefend with a strong focus on mobile and web application security, threat modeling, and secure DevSecOps automation. I specialize in identifying, exploiting, and remediating security weaknesses across complex systems — all while building scalable, automated pipelines for proactive defense.

With a foundation rooted in ethical hacking and hands-on penetration testing, I’ve expanded my expertise into custom SAST/DAST tooling, CI/CD integration, and real-world exploit simulation. My work includes projects like MobileMorph (an automated mobile app security framework) and BluJay (a custom static analysis engine), demonstrating my commitment to combining offensive knowledge with security engineering.

Driven by a continuous pursuit of mastery, I’m currently advancing through certifications such as PMPA, PWPA, and CRTO, with long-term goals of achieving CISSP and shaping security programs at the leadership level. As both a technologist and future CISO, I aim to bridge the gap between code, automation, and strategic security.
